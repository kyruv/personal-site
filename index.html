					<h2> About </h2>
				</div>
				<h3> &nbsp; Personal </h3>

				<p> I'm a 2nd-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/" target="_blank">University of Colorado Boulder</a>, and a researcher in the <a href="http://www.cairo-lab.com/" target="_blank">Collaborative AI and Robotics (CAIRO) Lab</a>, advised by <a href="http://www.bradhayes.info/" target="_blank">Brad Hayes</a>.</p>

				<p> I graduated undergrad from <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Cornell University</a> in 2018, where I majored in Computer Science, specializing in and conducting research into artificial intelligence and robotics with <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rak/" target="_blank">Ross Knepper</a>.</p>

				<p> Since 2016, I have spent four summers interning at NASA's <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> in Pasadena, California. I have worked on ground segment software projects in support of multiple Martian surface missions - both for the <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/" target="_blank">Mars InSight</a> lander and the upcoming <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/" target="_blank">Mars 2020</a> rover mision with the Instrument Data Systems group, and for the <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/" target="_blank">Curiosity</a> rover mission with the Rover Planning Systems group at <a href="https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">JPL Robotics</a>. During the summer of 2019, I also participated in the tactical rover planning process for Curiosity across multiple sols (Martian days). During those operations shifts, I accrued a career Martian odometry of 65 meters!</p>

				<p> For the upcoming summer of 2020, I will be returning to JPL Robotics to work on uncertainty modeling and characterization for Autonav, the self-driving mode of Mars rovers which enables significantly further daily driving range. </p>

				<p> Some of my interests outside of work include exploring the natural world, astronomy, aviation and space travel, and reading (usually a combination of sci-fi and Wikipedia articles).</p>

				<h3> &nbsp; Research </h3>

				<p> Autonomous systems are steadily becoming more capable, especially through the use of data-driven learned models. Despite the substantial advantages modern autonomy techniques present, they possess some key weaknesses that hinder their deployability in safety-critical systems (such as spacecraft) where they could potentially be most beneficial. Namely, models produced through these techniques are inherently uninterpretable by humans, which can lead to unforseen, potentially dangerous failures ultimately attributable to mischaracterization of risk.</p>

				<p> To help address these concerns, I'm interested in creating <b><font color="white">risk-aware shared autonomy</font></b> architectures for robotic task and motion planning, wherein human operator intuition is used to strategically and continuously shape and direct learning-based autonomous controllers. I hypothesize that such hybrid architectures will simulataneously reduce operator workload and add considerable plan flexibility when compared to traditional methods of robot operation, as well as reduce risk and unintended agent behavior when compared to state-of-the-art autonomous approahces.</p>

				<p> This research can be broken down into two primary thrusts, forming two sides of a bi-directional shared autonomy architecture; <b><font color="white">human in the loop planning</font></b> (methods for human operators to efficiently steer and augment optimization-based planners), and <b><font color="white">human interpretable risk assessment</font></b> (improving the situational awareness of operators by algorithmically presenting them with autonomous agents' understanding of sources of plan risk). Underlying both these thrusts is a shared emphasis on effective interface design; allowing operators to inspect model correctness and make informed decisions, while making the most of their cognitive abilities.</p>
